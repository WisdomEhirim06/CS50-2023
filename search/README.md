### Project Difficulty:
* **CSS Designs**: Designing sections, images to fit the webpage were difficult. It was basically trial and error, and this took most of the time.

### Project Specification:
* Creation of three webpages (Google Search, image and advanced search)
* Each page should be acessible through links.
* Advanced search should have four input field stacked vertically, and the text field should be left aligned.
* I'm feeling lucky button should be consistent with the main Google
* Generally, should have similar ashthetics with Google itself.
* Should return results of search query
