Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 1000
it seems like 1000 simulations displayed a different value

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100000

it seems like the predictions stabilized after 100000 simulations
