The code generally prints a user's height and then displays as a hash brick according to the value of the height.
To do this, first create a variable to make things a lot easier.
Since it wil only be an integer use the int.
Use cs50's get_int function to prompt an input.
Now to keep prompting, use a do while loop. Giving it a condition that only accepts a value between 1 and 8
Use the or || boolean values. When the input is below 1 or above 8. If it matches these condtions it will keep prompting if true and stop when false.
Next print the same value as stored, using the prinf value and %i\n for integers.
To display the hashes:
Use the for loop, incrementing the value of the int, to print a new line, if it is less than the inputed height.
then nest another for loop, with an integer, that is less than the previous one, and keep incrementing it.
To print the dots, make a new variable that is the deduction of the inputed height, so that it keeps on reducing as the pyramin increases.
If it works then remove the dots and test it.
